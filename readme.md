# WLED Presentation

This is a repository to hold documents and code for my presentation.

WLED is an "implementation of an ESP8266/ESP32 webserver to control NeoPixel (WS2812B, WS2811, SK6812) LEDs or also SPI based chipsets like the Ws2801 and APA102." More information can be found on the [WLED Project website](https://kno.wled.ge/).
